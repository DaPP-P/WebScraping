# Web Scraping
Author: Daniel Prvanov 

Welcome to my web scraping git repository, currently there are only two projects that I have worked on; My practice project, which contains a web scraper that scrapes whether data of New Zealand and my betting sites web scraper that scrapes betting sites odds to calculate potential arbitrage opportunities.

For more information on the betting site web scraper please read readme in BettiingSiteOdds folder.
